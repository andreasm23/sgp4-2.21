# Rules

This document contains the assignment text. We provide the [answer sheet](answer-sheet.md), where you fill-in the answers to the tasks listed in the [assignment text](/README.md). We call *report* to the edited answer sheet, after you fill-in your answers. Any modification to the assignment text, will be ignored.

## What do you need to submit

In addition to your report, you must submit all code and data that you used to find the answers to the assignment. This is important because:

- it legitimises your answers (we will check if your code really provides the answers you gave) and
- allows us to evaluate the approach you have taken.

## Assessment

You will be given points for your correct answers; wrong answers receive a fraction of the total points or none. Each task has a pre-defined set of points, reported below. 

**Please note**:

- all answers must be given. If your answer sheet is not complete, you automatically fail.
- your report is individual, which means:
  - you must use your code to find the answers you provide in the answer sheet, and
  - the code you submit must be of your authorship.
- we encourage you to cooperate with your colleagues at the **conceptual** level, so that you are safely within the requirements for an individual report mentioned above.

Referring to the [rubrics](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/498874/viewContent/2663586/View), the grade is split according to:

- 20% Clarity
- 40% Approach
- 40% Content

## Types of answers

You can expect to provide the following types of answers:

- **numeric**, which are assessed by numeric comparison with our own solution, and fall in *Approach* item of the rubrics;
- **plots**, which are assessed visually, and fall in *Clarity* and *Approach* items of the rubrics
- **open text**, related to answering questions on observations, interpretations and conclusions, generally from plot(s), which are assessed according to the *Content* and *Clarity* items of the rubrics.

An additional type of "answer" is the code you submit. It is assessed according to the *Approach* rubric item.

The table below illustrates how each type of "answer" relates to the rubrics items.

| Answer type   | Clarity | Approach | Content | Total |
| ---           | ---     | ---      | ---     | ---   |  
| all           | 20%     | 40%      | 40%     |       |  
| numeric       |         | 1/2      |         | 20%   |
| plots         |  1/2    | 1/4      |         | 20%   |
| open text     |  1/2    |          | 1       | 50%   |
| code          |         | 1/4      |         | 10%   |

## Excellence

If you address all assignments tasks correctly, your final grade is 8. To get a higher grade, you have several opportunities to show excellence. There are two types of Excellence:

- Assignment excellence, which is indicated in the assignment text by "**Opportunity for Excellence**", and
- [Coding excellence](#coding-excellence)

There is no specific formula for how much each excellence item is worth, because there are simply too many. Each one will be assessed individually.

We want to reward your efforts by being relatively liberal when grading Excellence. For example, you should get a 10 if your report is completely correct and you successfully address:

-  all Assignment Excellence items,
-  all Coding Excellence items, or
-  a comprehensive mix of Coding and Assignment excellence.

## Coding excellence

In addition to opportunities for excellence specific to this assignment, there are the following (non-exhaustive list of) coding opportunities for excellence:

- improved execution efficiency,
- elements of automation,
- non-obvious, creative and/or innovative algorithmics, and
- unit testing. 

You must report the opportunities for Excellence that you have addressed in your answer sheet in order for them to be assessed.
